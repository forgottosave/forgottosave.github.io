<tt>Why Blogs are useful</tt>
<p>Last week, I was searching for useful information and any content on how a boat charter process would look like. Very soon I realized, that the standard, big websites only contained very shallow knowledge about this topic. They were all lacking an important thing to me: Real-life examples. And this is, where a great (German) <a href="https://emanuelgrand.com/reisebericht-segeltoern-kroatien/">blog by Emanuel Grand</a> helped me out, describing his experience on his first charter, including everything I searched for.</p>
<p>This personal experience is something, big websites are lacking. And this doesn't only go for sailing. Nearly every topic you can think of can be explored on a much more personal level. Wether it is useful apps, how to improve productivity, sports, life hacks and much more, all of those topics can be deeply explored in a blog post.</p>

<tt>Why you should start a blog</tt>
<p>The answer to the question, why you should start your own blog, is quiet simple: Self Improvement.</p>

<tt>How to get started</tt>
<p>Now although only one thing is left, it is also the hardest step: getting started. But rest assured, starting your own blog doesn't require much at all. A pen & paper, smartphone, or laptop is all you need.</p>
