<tt>Why Blogs are useful</tt>
<p>Last week, I was searching for useful information and any content on how a boat charter process would look like. Very soon I realized, that the standard, big websites only contained very shallow knowledge about this topic. They were all lacking an important thing to me: Real-life examples. And this is, where a great (German) <a href="https://emanuelgrand.com/reisebericht-segeltoern-kroatien/">blog by Emanuel Grand</a> helped me out, describing his experience on his first charter, including everything I searched for.</p>
<p>This personal experience is something, big websites are lacking. And this doesn't only go for sailing. Nearly every topic you can think of can be explored on a much more personal level. Wether it is useful apps, how to improve productivity, sports, life hacks and much more, all of those topics can be deeply explored in a blog post.</p>

<tt>My motivation & why you should start a blog</tt>
<p>There are numerous reasons for starting your own blog. Mine were a mixture of documenting my own progress, practicing my english writing skills (since it's not my mothertongue) and simply for having something more useful than scrolling through social media in the evening. And there are many more (personal) reasons, why you should probably start your own blog, too.</p>
<p> • Changing your habits (stop endless scrolling)</p>
<p> • Learn new stuff during your research on your current blog topic</p>
<p> • Practice you writing skills (in your, or a foreign language)</p>
<p> • Document an important discovery made in the current month</p>
<p>So the general answer to this question is quiet simple: Self Improvement.</p>

<tt>How to get started</tt>
<p>Now, although only one thing is left, it is also the hardest step: getting started. But rest assured, starting your own blog doesn't require much at all. A pen & paper, smartphone, or laptop is all you need. If you want to do something more complex, you could of course also try to build your own website, like I did. But that is definetly not a strict requirement.</p>
<p> 1. Getting started:</p>
<p> For your first blog, you want to do something short and simple. Aim for a maximum of 3-5 minutes reading time. This will help keep your motivation up. Think of it like wanting to run a marathon: If you try to run the whole length on your first day, you will maybe manage to run a few miles before your body is drained and you give up. You lose motivation and don't recognize, that from the beginning you set yourself up for failure. The better solution would be to start small. Even running only one mile consistently for a week will help you keep your motivation and make it easy to gradually increase the distance. This also goes for writing. Wanting to produce a huge, well researched, professional blog post from ground up is hard. But if you start small, you will experience the moment of "I made it". The probability of you keeping that habit are dramatically increased. Chose a simple topic and begin to write!</p>
<p> 2. Publish you blog: </p>
<p>The next thing to think about is, where you want to publish your blog. The complex answer is to build your own website. But posting on any social media account will do just as well. Depending on your topics, you might also join dedicated blog platforms. One of the most popular ones include <a href="https://wordpress.org/">wordpress.org</a>, website tools like <a href="https://de.wix.com/">wix.com</a>, or <a href="https://www.blogger.com/">blogger.com</a>. (these are not sponsored by the way, just some examples to get you started).</p>
<p>Addressing the "building your own website" proposal: I built this website here, <a href="https://timon-ensel.de/">timon-ensel.de</a>, completely Open Source and hosted on GitHub, meaning you can also use it as a template for building and hosting your own website on <a href="https://github.com/forgottosave">GitHub</a> for free. I might create a blog article about this option in the near future.</p>

<tt>Summary</tt>
<p>As you can see, blogs are an easy way to publish your own thoughts, tipps and life hacks. They can be started because of many different motivations and be written by anyone. Just start by picking up your pen and let your thoughts flow.</p>
<p>Good Writing!</p>
